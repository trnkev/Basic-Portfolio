                Hi, my name is Kevin Tran. I am a part-time student at the University of Oregon Full-Stack Flex Program.
                My hobbies as of now are programming, playing my guitar, and hiking. So far programming is
                going well. It's keeping me up at night, but I don't have any regrets.
                <br><br>
                I am doing this program because I want to change career. I want to do creative and
                meaningful work while building relationships with interesting people. I believe 
                this industry will open doors to work in that space. If things don't work out, at least
                I know how to code. Also, coding is fun! 
            </p>
